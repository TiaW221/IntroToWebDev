  <h2> My History with Games Consoles </h2>
  <h3> This is where I talk all about my two favourite gaming console companies, and the games I love the most from each console.</h3>
  <p> I had my first console of sorts when I was four. This was called the Leapster Lmax. </p>

  <p> It was a learning games console created by the company Leapfrog and I loved it! I learned my alphabet through Dora the Explorer and Madagascar!</p>
  <p> As I got older, I got my first real console, the Nintendo ds. The first game I got on this console was Brain Training Academy.
